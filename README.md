Overview
In this workshop, we will learn the basics of manipulating data in React. So far, we have used React via a CDN. But from now on, we will use npmLinks to an external site. to create our front-end React applications.

Note: Make sure that you have Node.jsLinks to an external site. installed.

Be aware that these projects will use a few more files than we have used before. But, do not worry. All the complicated setup has already been done. And, we need to work in only one directory.

The React documentationLinks to an external site. recommends using a framework like Remix or Next JS to start a project. Although both are terrific frameworks, we do not yet need that much complexity in our applications. So instead, we will use a tool named Vite to help us build our project.

What Is Vite?
Vite uses tools in the background to bundle all our JavaScript files together, to transpile our JavaScript code, to manage packages that we might download through npm, and more.

In this workshop, we will use a list of furry friends as our data. And, we will learn how to work with the useState hook to render that data in the browser.
